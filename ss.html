  <h1>Schwarz Stein Scans</h1>
  <p>One of my favorite Visual Kei bands of all time! Even though I don't really listen to Visual Kei music that often, I have a huge soft spot for Schwarz Stein because they were one of the firsts I ever listened to and got really obsessed with them. I've always been bigger on electronic and industrial/darkwave music rather so I really appreciate that they're one of the few electronic bands in the genre. Even though I don't put them on often anymore, I have lots of great memories spending every waking moment listening to New Vogue Children and Artificial Hallucination. Also, Hora is one of my favorite people on planet Earth...</p>
	<h2>Magazines</h2>
	<p>These are from SHOXX and FOOL'S MATE. Some scans of these already exist on <a href="https://www.lerman.biz/asagao/schwarz_stein/gallery.html"> The Asagao Sites </a> which also archived scans from the old New Vogue Child fansite from the early 2000s, however what isn't archived on there is pretty hard to find and in low quality (I had to go on old Windows Movie Maker Youtube videos to find some of these scans). So, 
	I decided it would probably be easier if I just rescanned them for anyone else who wanted to see them. The interviews are also cropped out of the older scans, so for anyone who can read Japanese, you can read it now if you don't have a copy lol. I scanned them at a low DPI to save space and I have some weird scan lines so honestly they're kind of shoddy which is funny because scanners 20 years prior are doing better than me hahaha but hey, at least you can read the interview now in all its blurry glory. Oh, and on an unrelated note I have an extra copy of New Vogue Children with the slipcase (slight damage) and a new copy of Artificial Hallucination so if anyone wants to buy it email me or leave a comment I guess.	</p>
