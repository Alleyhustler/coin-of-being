 <h1>Treasure Games/Yasushi Suzuki Scans</h1>
 <p>Treasure definitely lives up to their name. They've created some of my favorite games of all time, and I highly recommend that anyone who likes SHMUPS and platformers check them out. This page will be dedicated to scans related to their games in addition to the work of Yasushi Suzuki, who did the artwork for Ikaruga and Sin and Punishment.</p>

 <p>CD included with Yasushi Suzuki's artbook released in 2017. The CD includes process photos, monochrome photos, previews of his work during that year, and extras. Consider purchasing the book if you are able to!</p>

  <h2>Ikaruga Doujinshi by CAN'T HUE/Nora Sekiji</h2>
  <a href="https://file.garden/ZedGlBo9KEiz9gSC/ika.zip">Download (24.3 MB)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>A series of doujinshi about the story of Ikaruga and Shinra and Kagari's relationship. For a SHMUP with such a rich story, it's a shame that literally none of it is uncovered in the actual gameplay. These doujinshi are very precious to me and have a lot of sentimental value, so I'm not sure if I'll ever scan the contents, but I have included higher-resolution scans of the gorgeous cover and backside art in the download link.</p>
  <br>
  <small>Small fun fact: the sketch on the scans directory is Yasushi Suzuki's concept art for the Ikaruga hangar.</small>
