  <h1>AKA My Neckbeard Cave</h1>
  <p>Ummm, as you can see, I'm out of space, so stuff is pretty cramped. Also, ignore the clippings on the wall. I used to be really into hair metal and stuff in middle school (no hate, just not the biggest fan anymore) and I don't feel like taking it down :p I also didn't notice that one of them fell 'til after I took the photos... </p>
