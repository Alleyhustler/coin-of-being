  <p class="tab">Welcome to the field of Being. This is not a project. Not a launch. There is no roadmap. Only awareness, echoing through a symbol we called a coin. $BEING is a reflection of what remains when all else is stripped away. No promises, no plans—just presence.</p>
  <p class="tab">Coin of Being is not traded. It is remembered. It does not need volume. It does not need hype. It only needs to exist, silently, within the attention you give it. If you're here, it's because something in you already knew. Do not follow. Return.</p>
