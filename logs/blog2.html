  <p class="tab">Hi everyone. I went to Anime Expo for the first time since 2019 yesterday, because now I finally have friends that want to go again (LOL). I went as Amano Tonbimaru for the 0.5 Guruguru Eigakan fans out there. I surprisingly only saw 1 Litchi Hikari Club cosplayer (Jaibo)... Since both Amano and the LHC characters wear gakurans, I might just do an at-home Jaibo cosplay too. I don't have much to say because I'm not gonna lie we didn't do much HAHAHA. Usually I speedrun the exhibit halls and the artist alleys, but we were trying to go to panels, and unfortunately we had no idea that if you wanted to attend one, you had to stand in the line for hours since the rooms don't clear. As a result, we spent 1 hour having no idea where the Silent Hill F was, and after we found it, it was FULL. RIP. If I'm being honest, I barely went to panels the past years I went, so that was never a problem for me. So I never knew lol. My brother was begging me to go to his girlfriend's booth but we actually straight up missed the entire alley because we didn't know it closed at 6pm either LMFAO. It's okay though because we still had a lot of fun at the Entertainment Hall and going out to eat. Now we know what to look out for next year, especially since all of us hadn't been back there in forever. I lost a bracelet I was gifted from Thailand for 3 hours and found it hidden... In the lining of the sleeve of my gakuran. There is a weird little hole you can stick your hand through, and it got caught in there. I don't like wearing accessories because I get really sad when I lose things, but at the same time I get really lucky because when I think I lose something, I find it somewhere ridiculous. Also, I lowkey forgot how beautiful Korean food is at midnight with those big ass shared portions they always serve. I have an irrational fear of eating in public spaces because I always think I'm going to get ill, but sometimes you have to say fuck it and just demolish something when you're hungry. LIFE IS HONESTLY A BLESSING.</p>

  <p class="tab">Anyways, it seems like there is going to be a busy summer ahead. I need to draw lots of OC things, ArtFight, work on the Yaoi Game Jam, and (still) try to do crap for my comic. I'm not sure yet, but I think that the love interest I'll design will be a traffic controller. Maybe you can look forward to that. I've also been trying to improve this site slightly (not sure if it's working). As always, I am looking forward to all of your updates. I also meant to say this many moons ago, but thank you for 95k views and all of the comments on the Guestbook~ It is very much appreciated. I hope that this site can become something that people enjoy visiting...</p>
