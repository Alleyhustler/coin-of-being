	<p>Below is a sample gallery of a few of the things you can find in the compiled collection.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Clippings</h2>
	<p>Various clippings from magazines throughout the 90s. I don't know exactly which magazines they're from, sorry.</p>

	<br>
	<h2>Electric Body Press (Fanclub)</h2>
	<p>Soft Ballet's fanclub, Electric Body Press. I only have volumes 1-19 (missing 20-22). They gradually go from 1 pages, to double sided, to 8 pages, to 12 pages. By the way, on volumes such as 8 and 9, it was held together by glue instead of staples.
		If you decided to buy it second-hand, just be aware there's a highly likely chance the pages will be loose.</p>
		<br>
	<div class="container">
	<ul class="block">
	<li>No. 11, 12, 13, and 16 have certain pages omitted because they contain sensitive information pertaining to the members.</li>
	<li>Pages with pictures of fans have been removed or edited out to protect their identity.</li>
	<li>Fan names have been removed.</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	<br>
	<p>I can't read Japanese so I may have missed some names. If you see anything that might be sensitive towards Soft Ballet's fans or members, please let me know so I can remove it. Thanks!</p>

	<h2>Film Photos</h2>
	<p>Random film photos from 1990-1992. Photos of bystanders have had their faces blurred so that their identities are protected.</p>
