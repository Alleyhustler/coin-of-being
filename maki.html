    <h1>Kusumoto Maki Scans</h1><br>
	<h2>KISSXXXX</h2>
	<p>Love story between Kameno and Kanon. It's groundbreaking in the way it features proto-lolita fashion while being first released in 1989, as well as being influential to many visual-kei bands. As far as I know, Kyo
	from Dir En Grey <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CYD-j8kv5xP/"> is a Kusumoto fan, </a> Hakuei from Penicillin did a Kanon cosplay for a PV, D=SIRE named one of their songs after KISSXXXX, and Ryutaro Arimura from Plastic Tree took fashion inspiration from K from K no Souretsu. He also took pictures with Kusumoto herself and sent her flowers during her exhibition! Oh, and this is 
	totally random but THORES Shibamoto is also a Kusumoto fan!!!</p>

	<h2>K no Souretsu</h2>
	<p>I always thought that this series was named after the G-Schmitt song but <a href="https://twitter.com/makikusumoto/status/1479573275281965060"> it actually has nothing to do with it.</a> It was purely coincidence!! I was so sure too, because I thought the gothic atmosphere really suited the story. </p>
