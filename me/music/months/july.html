  <p id="logdesc">This site has been tagged with "music" for years now, yet I never made a dedicated music page. So here it is. I'll try to update it periodically with some albums that I've listened or relistened to. This month will be a bit lazy because I just want to get this page up and running.</p>
  
 <p> I guess this month's theme is seeming like metal albums. I don't listen to metal as much as I used to in middle school, but I try to dip my toes back in every now and then. I'm always behind on releases as a result.</p>

  $("#description").html("<h2>An Autumn for Crippled Children - Try Not To Destroy Everything You Love</h2><h3>Logged:20250717</h3><h4>Favorite track(s): Autumn Again, Avoiding Winter </h4> <br> It's alright. I think it starts off strongly in the beginning, but I get a little bored near the middle, and honestly I'm not very enthused by the album as a whole. This might be a result of me not having an interest in anything from the shoegazey, ethereal-wave realm in general. The riffs were a bit flat and unintriguing, and the uniform quality of the songs make it difficult to differentiate the tracks upon the first few listens. But 'Autumn Again' is a genuinely amazing song. I love the progression into the 1:36 mark when the razor-sharp riffs come in. I really like the way tremolo picking sounds, so that's probably why I like it so much. The title track's trip-hop influence is also quite interesting too. I only wish that the album kept up this sonic, yet simultaneously atmospheric pace, but I understand that I'm probably not the target listener for an album like this. Maybe it will grow on me, like many bands do.");

  $("#description").html("<h2>Sunrise Patriot Motion - Black Fellflower Stream</h2><h3>Logged:20250717</h3><h4>Favorite track(s): Sunrise Labyrinthian, Oil Dream Field, Cruel is the Joke </h4> <br>I absolutely adore this album. It's probably my favorite discovery from this month. Found it by poking around stuff adjacent to Ustalost and Yellow Eyes. I had no idea these projects were all by the same brothers. They're very talented. This album reminds me a bit of Chat Pile in terms of delivery, content, and atmosphere; it's quite hallucinatory and bleak, yet bizarrely still reflects a reality of midwestern American doom in terms of the lyrics (or at least, my interpretation). The similarities don't surprise me, seeing as The Flenser added them to their summer playlist. I love the rich, gothically surreal melodies, contrasting with the hardcore vox, in addition to the touch of black metal inspiration found within the production/lo-fi quality of the vocals. It's a short and sweet album that is one hundred percent worth checking out and getting lost in.");

        case "3":
  $("#description").html("<h2>OLD SILVER KEY - Tales of Wanderings</h2><h3>Logged:20250717 </h3> <h4> Favorite track(s): November Nights Insomnia, Burnt Letters </h4> <br>Cool album. I've been listening to this before I sleep to be honest. I was interested in it more from the side of 'Drudkh's' participation in this project than 'Alcest's.' Would I be crazy to say that in some kind of roundabout way, it reminded me a little bit of A Perfect Circle...??? Or at least, their song '3 Libras.' Sorry if that's a blasphemous thing to say. It's a bit marred by the fact that it's not particularly ambitious, but it's certainly solid in the way that it's easy-listening and have catchy-enough melodies. If you listen to it expecting anything reminiscent of Drudkh though, it is in a pretty much completely different ballpark (post-rock), with basically zero black metal influence. So, just don't expect anything like that going in, and you should be golden. I think it's a pretty strong project with a nice, gloomy atmosphere enhanced by Neige's vocals. Just nothing groundbreaking (and doesn't have to be!).");

       case "4":
  $("#description").html("<h2>Apati - Morgondagen inställd i brist på intresse</h2><h3>Logged:20250717</h3> <h4>Favorite track(s): Morgondagen, Jag älskar dig </h4> <br>I really liked this album. I was surprised by how easily and digestible it would be listening to it, with the melodic post-punk inspired riffs and optimistic-sounding rock compositions of songs like 'Lämna mig ifred.' and 'Syndafloden' being placed in juxtaposition with the nihilism and depressingly sober depiction of reality in the lyrics. There's an interesting variety, and I most especially enjoy the songs that have a broodingly melancholic, yearnful characteristic to their soundscapes, such as 'I förträngda minnens sällskap' and 'Morgondagen.'");
    break;
  
       case "5":
  $("#description").html("<h2>Lifelover - Dekadens</h2><h3>Logged:20250717</h3><h4>Favorite Track(s): Luguber Framtid, Lethargy, Destination: Ingestans</h4><br>To be honest I can't get over how good this release is, at least the first half. I like Lifelover's later releases for their harder edge and somtimes faster pace, but still maintains the depressive atmosphere through the vox and lyrics. Not that drum machines are bad (One of my fave bands, Jigokue exclusively uses a drum machine too), but I think the addition of an actual drummer for this EP really enhances the clarity and cohesiveness, giving it that rawer edge as opposed to the sterile, flat sound that drum machines tend to have. I guess I like it because the more 'thrashy' riffs in Dekadens and Sjukdom, in contrast to the post-punk inspired riffs in Pulver and Erotik, feel more natural and visceral when in combination with the sobbing and growling vox. The 'depressive' part really shines through the sheer rawness of the aggression for me. Either way, their entire discography is awesome. I really enjoy all of their music.");
    break;
    
     case "6":
  $("#description").html("<h2>Kanashimi - Inori</h2><h3>Logged:20250717</h3><h4>Favorite track(s): Tomurai</h4><br>It's cute. I don't really listen to or know any Japanese BM except for Endless Dismal Moan (which I was really obssessed with my sophomore year of highschool lol) so this was pretty cool. I like the romanticism of the piano. Not sure how frequently I'd listen to it, but it was a nice experience. ");

     case "7":
  $("#description").html("<h2>Predella Avant - Der Zeit Ihre Kunst</h2><h3>Logged:20250717 </h3> <h4> Favorite track(s): I, II, IV, VII </h4> <br> As with many other martial industrial bands, there is absolutely nothing special going on. Typical case of symphonic music, written by a sweaty nerd that will never step foot in a warzone in their entire life, that can possibly be used as a background track in some kind of B-movie if given a generous assessment--but nothing more than that. That being said, it does not stop me from listening to the genre. This album is weaker than their album 'Carbon Figures,' which sets up a triumphantly apocalyptic setting with gritty industrial undertones, but still has some highlights in it's more neoclassically and liturgically-oriented approach. Certainly reminiscent of dark fantasy or medieval/chivalric settings, with bombastic horns and tenor drumming in the rhythm of a military march--a staple of every martial industrial band. I appreciate Predella Avant for being one of the fewer bands that have at least some kind of semblance of effort put into their compositions, because God knows how utterly vapid and creatively bankrupt some of these bands are (If you want to listen to something truly funny from this genre, check out Truart. They are True Art. Just fucking ridiculous.). Strangely, track four from this album is almost lifted in it's entirety by Triarii, another German martial industrial project, in his album 'Ars Militaria.' He possibly asked them to use the song for his own track 'Europe in Flames,' but it's a little weird because there's no credits mentioned. Either way, both versions are good.");

  $("#description").html("<h2>OVÄDER - Today Is Not Your Day</h2><h3>Logged:20250717</h3><h4>Favorite track(s): Bloodhype, Nån står med en skylt och säger nu blir det en feministisk revolution</h4><br>Pretty sweet digital hardcore band from Sweden. I discovered them after trying to look for digital hardcore bands that actually align with anti-fascist values, now that Alex Empire has tragically tunneled deeper and deeper into Chudlandia. I'm sad that this project has no more than two releases and seem inactive. They are fukken dope! Check it out :-)");

            case "9":
  $("#description").html("<h2>Dissection - Storm of the Light's Bane</h2> <h3>Logged:20250717</h3><h4>Favorite track(s): Night's Blood, Where Dead Angels Lie, Thorns of Crimson Death</h4><br>Not sure how I didn't listen to this sooner. I feel like I live under a rock somehow. I've been a longtime listener of Vinterland, but never actually checked out Dissection despite them being compared frequently, and the fact that they are a melodic BM classic. At first I wasn't too convinced, but as it progressed I was like 'Hey, it's pretty damn good.' The riff progressions are very satisfying. Thoroughly enjoyed this one a lot.");
    break;
    
      case "10":
  $("#description").html("<h2>Lifelover - Pulver</h2><h3>Logged:20250717</h3><h4>Favorite track(s): M/S Salmonella, Söndag</h4> <br> You know, I feel kind of crazy saying this but it's not really my favorite release from them. Like with what I wrote about Apati, I was surprised with how 'accessible' this album felt. I'm glad that Pulver was my first Lifelover album, because if I started with any of their other releases, I'm not sure if I would like this album the same. Nonetheless, I still like it and is a very solid release. I'm just more drawn towards their later discography.");
    break;
    
       case "11":
  $("#description").html("<h2>Minenwerfer - Alpenpässe</h2> <h3> Logged: 20250717 </h3> <h4>Favorite track(s): Der Blutharsch, Cloaked in Silence, Kaiserjägerlied, Withered Tombs</h4> <br> Not my first time listening to this album, but still wanted to talk about it a little bit because I relistened to it recently. I found them awhile ago on accident looking for releases from the martial industrial/neofolk band Der Blutharsch, which shares the same name as their most popular song. 'Blood-covered snow' in German seems like a pretty specific term, so... obviously I took interest in the fact that there was something /else/ that shared such a peculiar name. I'm glad, because I really love Alpenpässe in it's entirety. I feel like out of all the war metal bands that cover WW1, Minenwerfer definitely does it best in terms of atmosphere and storytelling developed through the usage of samples and the epically monumental passages in their tracks. The magnitude, especially on Der Blutharsch, is appropriately fitting, and I feel like it does justice trying to depict exactly how far-reaching and devastating WW1 was. I am a lot more compelled and intrigued by their albums in comparison to peers such as 1914 and Kanonenfieber, which unfortunately don't really grab my attention. Only thing I'll say is Tiroler Edelweiss is lame, and I think only German LARP fanboys like it. It's basically just a mid-ass neofolk song that interrupts my immersion into the album. If I wanted to listen to folk songs that aimed to derive feelings of ''''Heimweh,'''' patriotism, or describes the beauty of natural landscapes, I'd just listen to Werkraum's 'Unsere Feuer Brennen' or Forseti's 'Windzeit' and call it a day, because they are infinitely better. Shit, you could put any Rome album on and get the same vibe. Other than that, awesome stuff.");
