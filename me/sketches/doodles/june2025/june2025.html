<img src="shinra.png" height="900px">
<figcaption>Tried to make a design of Shinra from Ikaruga before the events of the actual game take place, super loosely based on <a href="../../../../../files.catbox.moe/6vlcxl.png" target="blank">this</a> concept art by Yasushi Suzuki when Shinra was still piloting the Shirasagi. I want to attempt to draw some better fanart now that a few years have passed. I replayed Ikaruga with a friend the other day and I got so excited talking about it I almost started crying (from joy) and had to relax. I also replayed Radiant Silvergun and relistened to the OST (Ikaruga's prequel). Since I was alone that time, I actually started crying (from joy). For all Final Fantasy Tactics fans, Hitoshi Sakimoto also composed the Radiant Silvergun OST, so please check it out. I forgot how much these games meant to me because I haven't thought about them in around 5 years. I'm horrible at them, but I really can't describe how great the visuals, OST, and overarching narrative of the games are... Also, Kotobukiya is opening preorders for the Ikaruga and Ginkei garage kits again. I wanted them so badly but they were out of stock back then. I want to try my hand at it, but apparently they are notoriously difficult. I'll save it for a rainy day.</figcaption>

<figcaption>Doodle of Amano Tonbimaru from Guruguru Eigakan. I'm planning to cosplay either him or Kaneda Riku from Litchi Hikari Club. I bought a second-hand gakuran and I'm going to replace the buttons with showa-era buttons to make it look a little more genuine. I also got an internship with my professor's journal but um. It seems very casual. The idea of going to his house for a meeting is very strange to me. It's with 2 other people though so maybe it won't be awkward (I don't want to be the first one to show up). </figcaption>
