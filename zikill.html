    <h1>Zi:Kill Scans</h1>
    <p>The first 3 Zi:Kill albums might be the best albums ever to me... I love their 1989-1991 post-punkesque sound that discontinued when they released Rocket and In The Hole... I know those are one of their most popular albums but to be honest, I really don't like them... 
	However, they're still a really solid band to me and Ken, Seiichi, and Tusk are really talented at what they do. All of their drummers are great too but personally the Yukihiro era is my favorite. And Tusk is still one of my great loves... Anyways, here are some scans of their fanclub stuff, flyers, clippings, etc. that I have. I have a pretty hefty amount but most of them are too big for me to scan
	so unfortunately I'm not able to get to a lot of them right now, but hopefully I can in the future. There's also some random stuff like New Years cards and Birthday cards that maybe I'll get to later. </p>

	<p>Some sample images from "King Off Zi:Kill." I'm not sure if that is a reference to one of their former fanclubs called "THE OFF," but either way it's a little funny that every issue crosses the extra F off. I may try to scan the inside content soon but for now, 
		here are the front and back covers. Pretty cute behind the scenes photos... </p>

	<br>
	<p>This thing comes in a black plastic file in which the photos are all loose and printed on a thick paper. The backside of all of them has the Zi:Kill logo on it while the photos of the individual members all have a basic bio of them and the stuff they like.

	<p>Most of these are from the CLOSE DANCE era. Probably the most interesting thing is the flyer with a handwritten note by Tusk on the back. I don't know what it says but I'm assuming it's about their next live information.</p>
