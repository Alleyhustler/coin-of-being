  <figcaption>Index illustration from around 2022-2025.</figcaption></figure>
  <p>I didn't change it for a long time because 1. I'm lazy and 2. It looked good and people seem to like it. I'm a little sad to put it away but I also don't want the site to remain stagnant. At the same time it was also necessary because this index drawing in particular was kinda a cop-out. I did not make this drawing specifically for this site. It was an old drawing I just resized and binarized (lol).</p>

  <figcaption>Third index image.</figcaption></figure>
  <p>This was only the index image for a short amount of time in 2022 because I thought it looked weird. I wanted to make the index image something related to my OCs and not an illustration by someone else, so I tried to draw Sid and Neenz as little mippy things.</p>

  <figcaption>The second index image for this site.</figcaption></figure>
  <p>It's the illustration of the Ikaruga by Yasushi Suzuki. It was the index image for quite a long time during around 2022 or so. I don't think anyone remembers this one because at the time, I was updating to nobody lol.</p>

  <img src="sephgrd.png">
  <figcaption>First index image.</figcaption></figure>
  <p>This isn't the exact image because I deleted it from my files and the image is saved on my old PC, but the very first index image was a diagram of the Tree of Life I found off an old esoteric Japanese website somewhere around 2021. It was the index image for a long time during 2021. This imagery was used in particular because this site originated solely as a Baroque fansite.</p>
