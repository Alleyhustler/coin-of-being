  <h1>Character Database</h1>
  <p class="desc tab">These are my characters that I plan on using in some sort of future comic... It's been something I've been randomly building on since my freshman year of highschool. It's just gonna be a slasher BL or something in a cyber/dystopic setting... Nothing too serious though cuz I can't write that well. I don't really like writing descriptions because I feel embarrassed, preferring to show their traits through drawings and doodles, but I do want to write a little bit about what I was thinking when I made them.</p>
  <p class="desc tab">I have a tendency to design my characters in pairs and occasionally in a group of 3 sometimes. A proper gallery page for each character will be made at some point!</p>

<td><h2>NAME: SID</h2>
<h3>AGE: 25</h3>
<h3>HEIGHT: 193 cm</h3>
<h3>DOB: 04/07</h3>
<p>A contract killer who is aloof externally, but is incredibly gap moe. :3</p>
<b>Design Notes</b>
<ul>
<li>He has two outfits: his initial "<a href="me/sid2.png" target="_blank">skin" mask</a> and orange jumpsuit, and his second more <a href="me/oc/sid.png" target="_blank">"tactical"</a> design.</li>
<li>He's a few years younger in his skin mask design but I can't ever decide on his age. His second design is actually supposed to be somewhere in the 30s. For now, his younger design is 24~25.</li>
<li>Evidently, the first design is super Slipknot inspired. The second one is a combination of Dorohedoro and Blame!</li>
<li>His load-bearing vest in his tactical design is based on the Individual Integrated Fighting System (IIFS).</li>
<li>He's one of my favorite and most personal OCs, who reflects myself the most. A lot of my drawings of him help me process my feelings of dysmorphia and struggles with self-image.</li>

<h3>AGE: 2X</h3>
<h3>HEIGHT: 175 cm</h3>
<h3>DOB: 01/16</h3>
<p>A contract killer working with Sid. Easygoing but behaves erratically. </p>
<b>Design Notes</b>
<ul>
<li>His design inspiration is Keith Flint from The Prodigy.</li>
<li>During his first design drafts, he had a stereotypically British punk appearance similar to Nobuo Terashima from Nana. Although he kept the spiked hair, I changed the British punk aspect because I think that there are enough characters that fit that archetype and appearance.</li>
<li>In the beginning, he wasn't supposed to be a contract killer. He was just a boutique employee...</li>
<li>Initially, he was supposed to wear a shirt with a different slogan every time (like Travis from Killer7).</li>

<h3>AGE: 28</h3>
<h3>HEIGHT: 178cm</h3>
<h3>DOB: 08/06</h3>
<p>Works with Mal at his shop, who also made his prosthetic arm. Characterized by an unusually strong sense of loyalty.</p>
<b>Design Notes</b>
<ul>
<li>He's named after Kazuma Kaneko.</li>
<li>I don't draw him as much anymore, but he's important to me because he began my artstyle shift into what it is today. Before that, I drew in a 70s-80s shoujou/josei style inspired by Keiko Takemiya, Riyoko Ikeda, Hagio Moto, etc.</li>
<li>He also has two designs like Sid (to be uploaded), with the second giving him a new prosthetic and a shaved head. The updated prosthetic design is inspired by horseshoe crabs.</li>

<p>Owns a dingy scrap and prosthetic shop in the outskirts of the city. Haughty and wants to prove his skills.</p>
<b>Design Notes</b>
<ul>
<li>His design was based on Paige Haley from Orgy and the band Zeromancer.</li>
<li>He also has a second design that I never uploaded on here, but it was inspired by ravewear such as Kikwear, Takuya Angel, Snug Industries, Macgear, SWEAR Alternative, etc.</li>

<td><h2>NAME: HÅKAN</h2>
<h3>AGE: Late 30s</h3>
<h3>HEIGHT: 185cm</h3>
<h3>DOB: 06/26</h3>
<p>Founder and leader of a PMC called Segervittring. His eyes hold a sinister quality to them despite his cordial and charming persona. Has strange tastes.</p>
<b>Design Notes</b>
<ul>
<li>His <a href="me/anime/vast.png" target="_blank">first designs</a> were inspired by Raymond Watts from PIG/KMFDM/Schwein.</li>
<li>His <a href="me/sketches/doodles/march2025/waaaa.png" target="_blank">younger design</a> is based on the field uniform of the National People's Army.</li>
<li>From the beginning, he always had a hat based on the Prussian Landwehrmütze cap and a day collar inspired by the brand Swedish Collar.</li>
<li>He was designed with bondage/leather culture and a military silhouette in mind, but also evolved to be a reflection of my love of uniforms from the German Democratic Republic.</li>
<li>I used to mentally flagellate myself over sexuality, so he's also an important OC to me because he is a means for me to kind of take control and liberate myself of the guilt I used to feel about it.</li>

<h3>AGE: Late 30s</h3>
<h3>HEIGHT: 183cm</h3>
<h3>DOB: 02/07</h3>
<p>Member of Håkan's PMC. High-strung, meticulous, and a little bit pathetic.</p>
<b>Design Notes</b>
<ul>
<li>His face is loosely based on a combination of both Conrad Veidt and Udo Kier.</li>
<li>His <a href="me/anime/ha.png" target="_blank">uniform</a> (anime and not detailed for now, sorry) is similar to Håkan's, but the insignia is of a lower rank, although higher than Vadim's (however, the ranks are purely decorative; the PMC does not formally have ranks).</li>

<h3>DOB: 01/18</h3>
<p>Member of Håkan's PMC. Vadim's younger sister. Reserved and takes things day-by-day. </p>
<b>Design Notes</b>
<ul>
<li>I was thinking about Oscar from Rose of Versailles appearance-wise in a rather roundabout way. Also a bit like Juri from Utena.</li>
<li>Her <a href="me/oc/kat2.png" target="_blank">alternate uniform designs</a> are also inspired by the uniforms for women in the German Democratic  Republic. The ranking insignia is the same as Vadim's</li>
<li>It doesn't make sense, but I like the way ghillie suit webbing looks without the leaves on it.</li>

<li>Spetsnaz-inspired</li>
